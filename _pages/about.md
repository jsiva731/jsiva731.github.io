Hi, I'm Jay! I'm a PhD student in Biostatistics at the University of Waterloo, supervised by Dr. [Ryan Browne](https://uwaterloo.ca/statistics-and-actuarial-science/profiles/ryan-browne) and Dr. [Michael Wallace](https://uwaterloo.ca/statistics-and-actuarial-science/profiles/michael-wallace). 

I obtained a Master of Mathematics in Biostatistics from UW in 2024, and a Bachelor of Mathematics Honours in Statistics from Carleton University in 2023.

This website is a work in progress.
